# Data-Pre-Processing
Notes:
- The code is written in PYTHON language.
- The V array refers to "Value" which is the variable that represents the brightness in HSV images varies from (0 to 255).
- In my code, I incremented the Brightness each time by 2.5, so that the code can generate 100 images of different brightness values from just one image.
- The code that i wrote goes through each (.JPG) file in the given path, then for each jpg image it generates 100 images.
 
Thank you.
